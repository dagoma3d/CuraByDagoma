## [2.0.0] - 2018-03-01
- New unified packaging: It implies a brand new software icon used in the application and in installation info for the various OS.

- No more preferences window but a Preferences menu item gathering the ability to change language and printer.
- Refine xml again.
- Set the model color to the color chosen by the user.
- The printerhead xml island (introduced in a previous version of Cura by Dagoma when the discoeasy200 printer head v3 was released) is no more needed when not necessary (ie. when a single version of the printer head is available).

- Remove xml islands on which the user has no way to modify parameters (linked to engine enumerations).

## [1.0.7] - 2017-12-01
- Fix crashes when changing a parameter during the slicing process.
- Add a filament color combo box depending on the chosen filament.
